# In this project, i simulated a simplified airport security system with a busy airport. Passengers arrive according to a Poisson distribution with λ1 = 5 per minute (i.e., mean interarrival rate μ1 = 0.2 minutes) to the ID/boarding-pass check queue, where there are several servers who each hexponential service time with mean rate μ2 = 0.75 minutes.  After that, the passenger assigned to the shortest of the several personal-check queues, where the through the personal scanner (time is uniformly distributed between 0.5 and 1 minute)
